                <p>
                    From the very beginning of my journey in IT, I've been drawn to automation, infrastructure as code, and cloud technologies.
                    My focus areas include DevOps, Linux system administration, and managing cloud infrastructure—primarily using AWS. I learn independently
                    through hands-on projects, building CI/CD pipelines and deploying infrastructure with tools like Docker, GitHub Actions, Ansible, and GitBash.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Right now, I’m working on this very portfolio to showcase my skills and projects. I also have a few new ideas in mind that I’m eager to bring
                    to life in the near future. One of my short-term goals is to earn the RHCSA and AWS Cloud Practitioner certifications, as a natural continuation
                    of the path I’m already on.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I’m a task-oriented person who works equally well on solo projects and in team environments. My ability to collaborate effectively stems from both
                    professional and personal experiences, where clear communication and shared ownership were essential to success.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Outside of tech, I’m deeply passionate about progressive metal music and regularly travel to concerts across Poland and abroad. I’m also into sports —
                    I’ve completed several half-marathons and enjoy working out at the gym, which reinforces my discipline, determination, and consistency.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In my free time, when I’m not coding, training, or learning, I like to unwind by playing video games — it’s my go-to way to relax and recharge.
